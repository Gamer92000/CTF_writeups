# install gentoo

![](installgentoo.png)

I can't and won't give a full writeup here!

However I will tell you how I got the flag.

* Wait patientley on the specifically created Discord
* Do what told in order to fight and trap `duncan_8bythepowerof2`
* Remind people with the rev shell that their stream was lagging because they got DDoSed
* Hope not to get kicked from the Discord due to lack of participation
* Be happy that Milkdrop gave us the flag despite not fully completing

### Flag: `X-MAS{So_guys_w3_d1d_1t_we_h4v3_1nst4ll3d_/G/3NTOO}`
